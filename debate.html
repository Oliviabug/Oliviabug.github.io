	    <h2>Austerity, a solution for future prosperity?</h2>
      <p> Austerity implies a cut in government spending during a period of weak economic growth. It is a deflationary fiscal policy, 
	  associated with lower rates of economic growth and higher unemployment. Some economists argue ‘austerity’ is necessary to reduce 
	  budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy.  
	   
	    <br>
	However, Keynesian economists argue that, in a recession, austerity can be ‘self-defeating’ with spending cuts causing a fall in
	aggregate demand, leading to lower economic growth. This leads to lower tax revenue and can offset the improvement from spending cuts.
	Should governments undertake austerity despite
	their weak economies, or could austerity actually be good for economic growth by ensuring intertemporal budget balance with associated
	benefi cial eff ects through, for instance, lower interest rates? The view favored by many commentators is that temporary fi scal expansion,
	not contraction, is needed in a recessionary or a slow-growth environment to return the economy
	to its full capacity.

	  <h2>Will Italy be the next European country in crisis?</h2>
    <p> In the months after Britain voted to leave the European Union last summer, some were concerned that a wave of anti-EU sentiment would build in other countries and cause the collapse of the block.
        Nowhere was that more true than in Italy.
        The country rejected a referendum on constitutional reforms that was widely seen as a vote against the establishment, 
	and led to the resignation of Matteo Renzi, one of the country's longest serving prime ministers in recent decades.

	  <br><br>
	Those fears diminished after Renzi was swiftly replaced by a new technocratic government under former foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni, and the rise of the Five Star Movement
	Now, however, Italy's problems — both political and economic — are rearing their heads once again, and could be the trigger 
	of the next major financial crisis, according to research from Deutsche Bank. A new research report from the bank compiled by a team
	led by famed strategist Jim Reid examines all the possible global events that could be catalysts for a new financial crisis, if and when one arrives.
	Events and issues that could trigger that crisis include an excessively fast unwinding of the ultra-loose central bank policy that has characterised 
	the post-crisis years.

    <br><br>
    Italy's inclusion, however, is an interesting one, with its problems neatly summed up by Reid and his team in their analysis.
    Italy is, they said: "A country nearing an election and with high populist party support, with a generationally underperforming 
    economy, a comparatively huge debt burden, and a fragile banking system which continues to have to deal with legacy toxic debt holdings ticks a number of boxes to us for the ingredients of a potential next financial crisis."
